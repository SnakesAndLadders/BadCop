# BadCop
BadCop is a simple little program built in Python. Use this to help spot BadUSB attacks and audit suspicious devices.

I would highly advise that you run this on a system you have set aside for security testing, as it provides no protection to it's host, it simply displays the capabilities advertised by the device.

Included is a python 3.6 script, if you use that you will have to install the following libraries:
 - Pickle
 - WX
 - usb.core

Or you can run the binary in the "dist" folder.
